A liposome is a small artificial vesicle, 
spherical in shape, having at least one lipid bilayer.
[2] Due to their hydrophobicity and/or hydrophilicity, 
biocompatibility, particle size and many other properties,
[2] liposomes can be used as drug delivery vehicles 
for administration of pharmaceutical drugs and nutrients,
[3] such as lipid nanoparticles in mRNA vaccines, and DNA vaccines. 
Liposomes can be prepared by disrupting biological membranes 
(such as by sonication).
